**Introduction**
Developed to tackle the high parking rates and hefty fines at university sports team facilities, this innovative solution streamlines the process
of parking payments. It leverages a Flask backend with an SMS-based frontend, integrating automated scripting and multiprocessing for immediate
payment execution upon spotting a ticket enforcer.

**Features**
- SMS-based User Interface: Simple and efficient for users to mark their parking status.
- Real-Time Payment Activation: Automated payment upon alert, reducing the risk of fines.
- Multi-user Coordination: Simultaneously manages multiple users' parking statuses and payments.

**Impact**
This system significantly reduces the likelihood of parking fines, enhances the ease of parking payments, and provides peace of mind to the sports team members.
It eliminates the need for manual coordination and quickens the payment process.

**Main Technologies Used**
- Python
- Flask
- Twilio
- Heroku

**Future Enhancements**
An exciting direction for future development involves leveraging machine learning to predict the arrival times of the parking ticket enforcer.
By exporting the logged payment times into a CSV file, we can accumulate a rich dataset of enforcer arrival patterns. This data can then be used to
train a ml model, which could predict the likelihood of the enforcer's arrival based on time of day, day of the week, and other relevant factors.
This implementation could further enhance the application's utility by providing users with proactive alerts and reducing the need for constant vigilance.
Demonstrating an innovative use of data science in practical, real-world scenarios.
